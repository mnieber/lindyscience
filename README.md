This is the repository for the Lindy Science swing dancing [website](http://www.lindyscience.tk).

## Technical stack

- The backend is based on Django and Graphql (through Graphene)
- The front-end is based on React, MobX and Redux

For reading the code, a good place to start is:

- [django/app/schema.py](https://github.com/mnieber/lindyscience/blob/master/django/app/schema.py) (back-end)
- [website/screens/containers/urlrouter.jsx](https://github.com/mnieber/lindyscience/blob/master/website/screens/containers/urlrouter.jsx) (front-end)
